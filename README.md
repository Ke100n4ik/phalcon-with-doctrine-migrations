# phalcon-with-doctrine-migrations
Migrations from the Doctrine with the Phalcon framework.
This is a working example, not just a library. It's based on an autogenerated Phalcon project.
The Doctrine is used here only for migrations from models annotations.
You can use the Phalcon as before, but now, you have code-based migrations!


### How to install

Run these commands in the root directory of your project:

```
php composer.phar self-update
```

```
php composer.phar update
```

Check database configuration in this file:
```
cli-config.php
```


```php
// the connection configuration
$dbParams = array(
    'driver'   => 'pdo_mysql',
    'host'     => 'localhost',
    'user'     => 'root',
    'password' => '',
    'dbname'   => 'test',
);
```


### How to run

Run this command in the root directory of your project:

```
php doctrineConsole.php orm:schema-tool:update --force
```

Check your database!

### Other steps
Now you can start to develop a new project on this skeleton, or rebase the existing one on this structure.
